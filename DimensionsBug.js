This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` methods might return incorrect or inconsistent values, leading to layout issues or unexpected behavior.  This is often due to the timing of the measurement or a mismatch between the application's orientation and the actual screen dimensions.

```javascript
// Incorrect dimensions leading to misaligned elements
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
<View style={{ width: width / 2, height: height / 2 }}/>
```
